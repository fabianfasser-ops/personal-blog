        <p class="hero-text">
          I’m a Solutions Engineer at Cisco, working with Service Providers across Switzerland to solve complex challenges with tailored, customer-focused solutions. With a background in software development, automation, and monitoring, I enjoy helping people make the most out of technology: simple, effective, and built around their needs.
          I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Information Technology and I am currently pursuing an MBA at IE University, further strengthening my ability to bridge technology and business strategy.
          I genuinely believe that culture eats strategy for breakfast, because great results start with trust, collaboration, and strong relationships.
          Outside of work, I’m always up for a good game of ice hockey, skiing in the mountains, or discovering new places and cultures. And yes, I never say no to a great coffee.
          Let’s connect!
